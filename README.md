RecatwebPageVT


This project include both frontend Reactjs and backend(nodejs) for fetch data from mongodb.

In the beginning  create a database called MyNewDatabase and create collection called VirtualCapitalDB. then add few data to that (firstnamr,lastname, videocount)
Then run this command inside backend folder "node VT1.js".This will start the nodejs server. Then to test it run "http://localhost:8080/users" using web browser this will display all the data inside database.

Then run the react  app using npm start command. use computer IP and nodejs server running port as url. ex:-"http://192.168.8.50:3000".

If you host that app.js then use that host url as fetch URL.
